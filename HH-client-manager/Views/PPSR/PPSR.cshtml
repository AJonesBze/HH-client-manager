    <p>
        The following statements identify feelings or experiences that some people use to describe themselves.
        Please answer each question in terms of any aspects of your personal identity that are important to you as a woman, such as gender,
        race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, sexual orientation, family background, etc.
        Write your answers in the space to the left of each question using the scale below.
        For example, for the statement “I have equal relationships with the important others in my life” you would write 1 if this is never true of you now,
        7 if this is true of you almost all the time, and 2 through 6 if the statement is usually not true, sometimes true, or frequently true for you in your life now.
        There are no right or wrong answers.
        <br />

        Almost never&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes true&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost always
